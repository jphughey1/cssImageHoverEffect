        <h2>2019 Ferrari 488 Pista Spider Offers 710 HP without a Roof</h2>
        <p>
          A 30-mph wind can tear a baseball cap off your head on a gentle boat
          cruise, so just imagine your forehead dipping into the airstream of
          this open-roof Ferrari. It can do 211 mph—same as the coupe—with its
          roof up. Ferrari can't confirm that top speed with the top down on the
          new 488 Pista Spider, the folding-roof version of Maranello's most
          extreme V-8 supercar, but it's not going to be ballcap-friendly with
          more than 700 horsepower pushing it through the air.
